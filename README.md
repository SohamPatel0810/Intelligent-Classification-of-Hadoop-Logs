# MSCI641 Final Project
## Critical Logs Classification using Various Natural Language Processing

This repository contains all the code for our MSCI 641 Final Project.

## How to run the project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dhairya1007/MSCI641_Final_Project
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd MSCI641_Final_Project
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory. (the Hadoop dataset is already in place)

5. The first step is parsing the raw logs in the data directory. This can be done by running the parse_logs python script in the logalyzer directory.

    ```bash
    cd logalyzer
    python parse_logs.py
    ```

6. Now, for data preparation and model training, just run the train python script.

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

## Project Usecase

We present a novel approach of classifying critical Hadoop system failures using the raw logs generated by the cluster while running the application. By leveraging various natural language processing techniques, we aim to accurately identify and classify different types of system failures, enabling faster troubleshooting and resolution.
